# Medical Cost Prediction (Linear Regression)

This project predicts **medical insurance charges** based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, region, etc.  
It includes **two implementations**:

1. **From Scratch (No Libraries)**  
   - Implements data preprocessing, normalization, gradient descent, and linear regression manually.  
   - Useful for understanding the math and internals of regression.  

2. **Using Libraries (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib)**  
   - Uses `LinearRegression` from `sklearn` for faster implementation.  
   - Easier, cleaner, and production-ready.
